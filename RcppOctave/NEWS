Changes in 0.19
********************
NEW FEATURES
    o Added a plugin for inline::cxxfunction to call Octave functions within
    C++ code. 
FIXES
	o .CallOctave gains an argument plot (default to TRUE), to ensure force
	plot windows to be drawn after Octave calls (issue #).
	o Fixed compatibility issues with Octave versions 3.8, 4.0 ad 4.2, 
	thanks to work by Steven Bergner (pull request #17).

********************
Changes in 0.18
********************
FIXES
	o Fixed installation problem on Windows for R >= 3.2, due to 
	toolchain incompatiblity. Now requires that the 4.9.2 toolchain
	available from CRAN is located under the Rtools directory. 

********************
Changes in 0.16
********************
NEW FEATURES
    o Added Octave function randp for Poisson distribution (issue #8)
FIXES
    o Fixed compatibility bug with Octave 4.0.0. See ?o_config_info (issue #5).
    o Added configure option --diable-rprofile to disable loading in internal 
    R calls during installation (issue #6)   

********************
Changes in 0.14.5
********************
FIXES
    o Mac support: look also for .dylib files when default .so files don't exist
    (issue #2)
    o Mac support: make sure Octave modules and package shared object are built 
    using the same compiler/toolchain used by R (issue #1)
    o Makevars.in now has CXX_STD = CXX11, which gets rid of C98 warnings when 
    compiling shared object.  

********************
Changes in 0.14.3
********************
FIXES
    o Fixed typo in rcpp_octave.h which was causing an installation error on FreeBSD:
    SWIF_OCTAVE_PREREQ should be SWIG_OCTAVE_PREREQ.
    
********************
Changes in 0.14.2
********************
NEW FEATURES
    o Function .CallOctave gains a new argument `verbose` to specify a temporary 
    verbose level
FIXES
    o Fixed installation issue on Windows that were introduced with new installation
    features in 0.14.
    o Fixed bug in output redirection when linking against old octave 3.2: method str() 
    was not defined

********************
Changes in 0.14
********************
CHANGES
    o added a configure option --with-octave to specify the path to a non-standard
    Octave installation. For example:
    R CMD INSTALL --configure-args="--with-octave=/opt/octave" RcppOctave_0.14.tar.gz
    o Handling of Octave outputs and error messages have been improved.
    
FIXES
    o Some changes have been made so that the package is compatible with Octave 3.8
    (reported by Bernard)
    o Installation was failing when Octave was compiled with hdf5-mpi support.
    
    
********************
Changes in 0.11
********************
NEW FEATURES
    o The package have successfully been installed on Windows machines, 
    although only basic functionalities have been tested (see README file).
    o Support for Mac have also started, although even more slightly, using
    the Octave version available from homebrew.

CHANGES
    o Moved all developments/bug reports/static docs to GitHub repository:
    https://github.com/renozao/RcppOctave/ 
    o Octave functions' stdout and stderr messages are now buffered by default, so 
    that it does not bypass R own i/o functions.
    All messages/warnings sent to stdout/stderr from Octave are displayed on 
    exiting the function call.
    o function .CallOctave gains a new argument buffer.std to enable/disable 
    stdout and/or stderr buffering (see ?.CallOctave).
    o Octave startup warnings (e.g. shadowing of core functions by Octave modules) 
    are not shown anymore.
    o Minor adaptations to pass new CRAN checks
    o The package now depends on R >= 3.0.0 to properly handle the knitr vignettes.
    o Errors are now more properly handled, thanks to hints found in this 
    old post by Romain Fran√ßois:
    http://lists.r-forge.r-project.org/pipermail/rcpp-devel/2010-May/000651.html

********************
Changes in 0.9.3
********************
CHANGES
    o Conditional use of function packageName: use the one from pkgmaker 
    in R <= 2.15.3, or the one exported by utils in R >= 3.0.
